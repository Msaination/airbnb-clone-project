ALx AirBnB Clone project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development 
of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, 
focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.




## Team Roles

The project team consists of the following roles, each with distinct responsibilities:

- **Business Analyst (BA):** Gathers and analyzes business requirements, ensures stakeholder needs are clearly understood and documented.
- **Product Owner (PO):** Defines the product vision, prioritizes the product backlog, and represents the customer's interests.
- **Project Manager (PM):** Oversees project planning, execution, and delivery; manages timelines, budgets, and team coordination.
- **UI/UX Designer:** Designs user interfaces and optimizes user experience for usability and aesthetic appeal.
- **Software Architect:** Defines the overall system architecture, selects technologies, and ensures alignment with technical standards.
- **Software Developer:** Writes, tests, and maintains the application codebase according to project specifications.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:** Develops test plans, executes testing, and ensures the product meets quality standards.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Manages deployment pipelines, infrastructure automation, and system reliability.

Each role collaborates closely to ensure the success of the project, adapting as needed throughout the project lifecycle.

## Technology Stack

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework:** Provides tools and libraries for creating and managing RESTful APIs within Django.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system used for reliable and scalable data storage.
- **GraphQL:** A query language that allows flexible and efficient data retrieval from the API.
- **Celery:** A distributed task queue used for handling asynchronous tasks like notifications and payment processing.
- **Redis:** An in-memory data structure store used for caching and session management to improve performance.
- **Docker:** A containerization platform for creating consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated workflows that build, test, and deploy code changes, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.

  ## Database Design

The key entities in the project and their important fields are:

- **Users**
  - user_id (Primary Key)
  - name
  - email
  - phone_number
  - role (e.g., customer, host)

- **Properties**
  - property_id (Primary Key)
  - owner_id (Foreign Key to Users)
  - title
  - description
  - location
  - price_per_night

- **Bookings**
  - booking_id (Primary Key)
  - user_id (Foreign Key to Users)
  - property_id (Foreign Key to Properties)
  - start_date
  - end_date
  - status (e.g., confirmed, cancelled)

- **Reviews**
  - review_id (Primary Key)
  - user_id (Foreign Key to Users)
  - property_id (Foreign Key to Properties)
  - rating
  - comment

- **Payments**
  - payment_id (Primary Key)
  - booking_id (Foreign Key to Bookings)
  - amount
  - payment_date
  - payment_method

### Relationships

- A user can own multiple properties (one-to-many from Users to Properties).
- A user can make multiple bookings, but each booking belongs to one user (one-to-many from Users to Bookings).
- Each booking is for a single property, while a property can have multiple bookings (one-to-many from Properties to Bookings).
- Users can leave multiple reviews on properties they have booked, while each review is tied to one property and one user.
- Each booking has one payment associated with it, linking payments to bookings in a one-to-one or one-to-many manner.

This structure ensures organized data storage and efficient querying for user, property, booking, review, and payment information.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management:** Enables user registration, authentication, and role-based access control, allowing customers, hosts, and administrators to securely interact with the system.

- **Property Management:** Allows property owners to list, edit, and manage details of their properties, including descriptions, pricing, and availability.

- **Booking System:** Facilitates searching, reserving, and managing bookings for properties with real-time availability checks and booking status updates.

- **Review and Rating System:** Lets users leave feedback and ratings for properties they have stayed at, helping future users make informed decisions.

- **Payment Processing:** Supports secure payment transactions for bookings, including processing various payment methods and managing payment confirmations.

- **Notification System:** Sends automated notifications such as booking confirmations, reminders, and status updates via email or SMS.

- **Reporting and Analytics:** Provides insights on booking trends, revenue, and user activity to inform business decisions and optimize operations.

- **Admin Dashboard:** Offers administrative tools to monitor and manage users, properties, bookings, and system settings efficiently.

These features work together to create a seamless and efficient property booking experience for both users and administrators.
